# Feast It Front-End challenge

Hey! ðŸ‘‹

This open-ended challenge is your chance to show us your experience with React. We recommend spending about 2-3 hours on the challenge, however, we donâ€™t expect you to have completed every piece of functionality. We will use the outcome of the challenge as part of our evaluation process.

### The brief

Develop a React web app that maintains a list of bookmarks. A user should be able to add, edit or remove any bookmark on the list.

You are free to design it as you think best, either with an inline form or separate pages for displaying and adding bookmarks. Please also consider the design and user experience of the app as this will be part of our review.

### Setup

1. Clone this repository
   - This repository uses [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Run `yarn start` or `npm start`

### Requirements

- The user should be able to add, edit and delete the bookmarks
- The form must validate that the input is a valid URL and display appropriate error messages
- Bookmarks must persist page reload (use LocalStorage)
- The UI should be styled using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/styled) which is included in the project for you. Check out [this example component](src/components/Header)
- Commit regularly with well-formed commit messages. We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)
- When finished, deploy the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or similar
- Write a brief summary in the [CHALLENGE_NOTES](CHALLENGE_NOTES.md) about your process, your choices, and any challenges you faced

### Tips

- Add some tests. Check out [this example](src/components/Header/Header.test.js)
- Use [Typescript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript) if preferred
- Be creative e.g. animations. We use [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/)

### How to submit

- Push your code to your own private repository and add [@stevengeorgeharris](https://github.com/stevengeorgeharris) as a collaborator
- You can also zip the repository and [send it to us](mailto:steven@feast-it.com)
